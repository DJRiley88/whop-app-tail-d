# Analytics Functionality Test

## What was implemented:

1. **Created Analytics Page** (`/app/analytics/page.tsx`):
   - Comprehensive analytics dashboard with key metrics
   - Time range filtering (24h, 7d, 30d, all time)
   - Top sportsbooks and leagues visualization
   - Bet performance table
   - Time range comparison charts
   - Responsive design matching the app's dark theme

2. **Made Analytics Button Functional**:
   - Wrapped the "ANALYTICS" button in the creator dashboard with a Link component
   - Button now navigates to `/analytics` when clicked
   - Maintains the same styling and hover effects

## Key Features:

### Analytics Dashboard:
- **Key Metrics Cards**: Total tails, unique tailers, average per bet, conversion rate
- **Top Sportsbooks**: Visual ranking of most popular sportsbooks
- **Top Leagues**: Most engaged leagues by tail count
- **Bet Performance Table**: Individual bet metrics with conversion rates
- **Time Range Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison across different periods
- **Interactive Controls**: Time range selector, refresh button, download option

### Navigation:
- Back button to return to dashboard
- Seamless integration with existing routing
- Consistent styling with the app theme

## Testing Steps:

1. Navigate to the creator dashboard (`/dashboard`)
2. Click on the "ANALYTICS" button in the Quick Actions section
3. Verify you're taken to the analytics page (`/analytics`)
4. Test the time range selector (24h, 7d, 30d, all)
5. Verify all metrics are displayed correctly
6. Test the back button to return to dashboard
7. Check responsive design on different screen sizes

## API Integration:

The analytics page integrates with the existing `/api/analytics` endpoint which provides:
- Total tails by time range
- Unique tailers by time range  
- Average tails per bet
- Tail window conversion rate
- Top sportsbooks and leagues
- Individual bet performance metrics

## Styling:

- Consistent with the app's dark theme (`#0F0F0F` background)
- Uses the same color scheme (`#3EE58D` accent, `#B0B0B0` text)
- Responsive grid layouts
- Hover effects and transitions
- Card-based design matching the dashboard
