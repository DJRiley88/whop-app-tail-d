# Deployment Instructions for Whop App

## üöÄ Deploy to Production

### Step 1: Seed Your Database

Your database is currently empty. You need to seed it with demo challenges and data.

#### Option A: Run Locally

```bash
# Make sure you have your .env.development.local file with database credentials
pnpm run seed
```

#### Option B: Run on Vercel (Recommended)

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Open the "Deployments" tab
3. Find your latest deployment
4. Click on the deployment ‚Üí "Logs" tab
5. Open the terminal/console and run:
   ```bash
   pnpm run seed
   ```

#### Option C: Use Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if you haven't
npm i -g vercel

# Run seed command on your deployment
vercel env pull  # Pull environment variables
pnpm run seed
```

### Step 2: Verify Your App URL

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Make sure your Whop App URL is set to your **root Vercel URL**, not a specific challenge URL.

**Correct App URL:**
```
https://your-app.vercel.app
```

**Incorrect App URLs:**
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/experiences/123  ‚ùå
https://your-app.vercel.app/dashboard        ‚ùå
```

### Step 3: Update Whop App Settings

1. Go to https://dashboard.whop.com
2. Navigate to "Develop" or "Apps"
3. Find your app
4. Click on it ‚Üí "Settings"
5. Update "App URL" to your Vercel production URL (root URL only)
6. Save changes

### Step 4: Test Your App

1. Install your app into a Whop space using the "Install" button
2. The app should now load and show:
   - Dashboard with demo challenges
   - Active challenges you can explore
   - Leaderboards with demo data

### Step 5: Submit to App Store

Once everything works:

1. Go to your app in Whop Dashboard
2. Click "Submit to App Store"
3. Fill in the required information:
   - App name and description
   - Screenshots (at least 3)
   - Category
   - Pricing (if applicable)
4. Submit for review

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Challenge Not Found" Error

**Cause:** Database is empty or app URL is pointing to a specific challenge that doesn't exist.

**Solution:**
1. Run the seed script: `pnpm run seed`
2. Make sure your Whop App URL is the root URL (see Step 2)
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Reinstall the app in Whop

### Issue: Database Connection Error

**Cause:** Environment variables not set correctly in Vercel.

**Solution:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Verify these variables are set:
   - `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` - Your Supabase/Postgres connection string
   - `WHOP_API_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID`
3. Redeploy after updating environment variables

### Issue: App Not Loading in Whop

**Cause:** App URL configuration is wrong.

**Solution:**
1. Check that your Vercel deployment is live (green status)
2. Verify the App URL in Whop dashboard is correct
3. Try opening the URL directly in a browser to test
4. Make sure there are no CORS issues
